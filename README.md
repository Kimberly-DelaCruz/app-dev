*Tomorrow is a korean drama series that teach a lot of lesson when it comes to mental health. They are grim reapers that instead of getting left, they save the one who wants to take thier lives. They show different scenario and situation of people even an animal. They give hope to the people who struggles in life and somehow if you watch it, it also help and enlighten you especially if you have the same situation like in the series. Thre are also a lot of twist in every episode taht you will not get bored and didn't expect that to happen especially the life of the grim reapers. There is also a disclamer for those who can't watch those kind of topics and that is good so thet the people who want to watch will be aware on what kindi of series they will watch because without those cautions some people might trigger to those scene. Some lesson that I personally learned in this serie are:   *

: Check on your love ones becaus ethey might experience simillar problem on the series
:  It is okay to seek help especially to professionals
: Try to find your outlet or the person/things you can open up or release your emotion and also gives you energy
